# Magic-8-Ball
Simple program that generates 1 of 14 predefined responses for any yes-or-no question a user asks. 

The user inputs any yes or no answer and the program returns one of fourteen responses. The user may ask as many questions as they want, and the program will terminate only if the user states that they no longer want to ask any more questions.

The program includes simple input validation/error handling. 

Accepted inputs for questions must end in a question mark. Accepted inputs for whether the user wants to continue the program must be yes, no, y, or n (not case sensitive).
